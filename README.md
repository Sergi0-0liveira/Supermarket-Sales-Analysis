# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis

In this project I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python. 
Using packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc. to conduct univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and correlation analysis.
I also used this packages to identify and handle duplicate/missing data.
